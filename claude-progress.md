### Blocked / Needs Human
- [ ] Push to GitHub - requires SSH key setup for git@github.com
- [ ] Human approval for Phase 1 plan before proceeding to Phase 2

### In Progress
- [ ] Awaiting human review and approval of generated plan

### Decisions Made
- **Project Focus:** Web applications using Next.js full-stack architecture
- **Target Users:** Solo developers and small teams building MVPs
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 14 + TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Railway hosting
- **Architecture Pattern:** Monolith for MVP, microservices later if needed
- **Human Gates:** Planning approval, architecture approval, production approval
- **MVP Timeline:** 52-68 hours estimated (1.5-2 weeks focused development)
- **First Test Case:** Simple CRUD application to validate entire workflow

### Next Steps (After Human Approval)
1. Set up GitHub authentication (SSH keys or alternative)
2. Push all Phase 1 documentation to GitHub
3. Begin Phase 2: Detailed Architecture
4. Generate system architecture diagrams (Mermaid)
5. Create API specifications (OpenAPI)
6. Define data models and component breakdown

### Decisions Made
- Project name: autonomous-workflow
- Using main/dev branch strategy as planned
- Following exact Phase 1 workflow from specification
